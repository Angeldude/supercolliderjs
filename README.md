supercollider.js
================

This is intended to be a minimalist port of the primary SuperCollider classes for control of objects on an scsynth server over OSC.

It works in Node.js now and the main classes are intended to eventually work in a webrowser.

* Server
* LocalServer

* Synth
* Group

* Bus
* Buffer

And perhaps SynthDef and UGens
